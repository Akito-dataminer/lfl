# About this application
I named this application "Latest updated FiLe".

This application prints the most recently modified files to the command line.

# Motivation
I wanted to practice using GitHub and creating c++ application.
This is the biggest purpose.
So, please don't except completeness of this application.

Rarely, I want to know the latest file in some directories.
I can achieve the purpose with bash.
However, using bash on Windows is hard.
So, I wanted an application to know the latest file in some directories.

# Requirement
I tested on Windows 11, not other environments.

# Usage
## lfl \<directory\>
output: the recent file in the <directory>

## lfl \<directoryA\> \<directoryB\>
output: the recent file in the <directoryA> and <directoryB>

the output is only one file ( not two files ).
